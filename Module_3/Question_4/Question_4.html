<!-- Canvas and SVG tags
      
Canvas and SVG are two different approaches used in web development for creating graphics and interactive visual content.



The <svg> tag is another HTML element used for defining two-dimensional vector graphics. Unlike the canvas, SVG is based on XML and uses declarative syntax to describe graphics. Each element in SVG represents a graphical object (e.g., shapes, lines, curves), and the properties of these elements can be defined using attributes or CSS styles. SVG graphics are resolution-independent and scale smoothly without losing quality.
Key points about the <svg> tag:

   Example of using the SVG element:

   <svg width="500" height="500">
   <circle cx="250" cy="250" r="100" fill="red" />
   </svg>
