<!-- Whar are the different tags to seperate sections of text?

There are three tags that can be used to separate the texts:

<br> tag – Usually <br> tag is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and conveys the flow to the next line

<p> tag – This contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.

<blockquote> tag – It is used to define a large quoted section. If you have a large quotation, then put the entire text within <blockquote>……….</blockquote> tag.
