   The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest available.

   This means that no other number is lesser than this value.

   Note: JavaScript shows the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.

   Negative infinity is a number in java script, which is derived by 'dividing negative number by zero'.

   Example:
   -->
   <p id="demo"></p>
   <script>
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=(-1/0);
  </script>
