<!-- What is the function of the delete operator?

      operator is more specifically used to delete JavaScript object properties.

      The JavaScript pop(), shift(), or splice() methods are available to delete an element from an array. But because of the key-value pair in an object, deleting is more complicated.

      syntex:
      delete object
      or
      delete object.property

      Note that, the delete operator only works on objects and not on variables or functions for example;,
      let num = 5;
      let sum = (a, b) => {
         return a + b;
      }
      
      console.log(delete num); //false
      console.log(delete sum); //false
