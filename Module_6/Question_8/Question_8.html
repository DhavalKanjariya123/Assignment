<!-- In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?

n Bootstrap 4, flexbox refers to the use of the CSS Flexible Box Layout module to create flexible and responsive layouts for web pages. Flexbox is a powerful layout system that allows you to distribute space and align items within a container along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically) and control their sizing and positioning with ease.


Flex Containers: In Bootstrap, a flex container is created using the .d-flex class. This class is applied to an element to make its children (flex items) follow the flexbox layout rules.

Flex Items: The children elements of a flex container are referred to as flex items. These items can be any HTML elements, and they will be arranged and styled according to the flexbox rules.

Flex Direction: The .flex-row, .flex-row-reverse, .flex-column, and .flex-column-reverse classes are used to set the direction of the main axis and the cross axis for the flex container.

Flex Justify Content: The .justify-content-* classes are used to align the flex items along the main axis of the flex container.

Flex Align Items: The .align-items-* classes are used to align the flex items along the cross axis of the flex container.

Flex Align Self: The .align-self-* classes are used to control the alignment of individual flex items along the cross axis.

Flex Wrap: The .flex-wrap class is used to make the flex items wrap to a new line when they exceed the width of the flex container.

Flex Order: The .order-* classes are used to control the order in which flex items appear within the flex container.
